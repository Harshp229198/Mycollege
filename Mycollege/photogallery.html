      <h1>We Are Create The Future</h1>
      <p>
        In my close association with the field of education in recent years, I have observed that while institutions are built on the pillars of faculty, research, infrastructure, collaborative and administrative strengths, it is affirmed that it is only a passion for excellence which elevates it to a high order.
        <br>
        <br>
        I feel greatly inspired when I see Pandit Deendayal Energy University evolve into an institution which can hand-hold students through a transformational journey where knowledge is acquired while nurturing excellent human values, where learning has moved beyond the classroom - all proving to be priceless assets in oneâ€™s professional life.
